Developer's Note:
The role IDs in the bot are the ones for my server. You probably have to copy your own by setting discord to developer mode.

Requires:
Microsoft .Net Core 3.1

DSharpPlus
DSharpPlus.CommandsNext
DSharpPlus.Interactivity

A config.json file in the form of
{
"token": "your bot's discord auth token"
"prefix": "the prefix you want to use" (mine uses ?)
}
